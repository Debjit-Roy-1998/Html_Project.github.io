   </font face="serif" size="20px"><P>The popular programming language Java has been around for more
     than 20 years. Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability, security, 
     and scalability. Being a cross-platform language, its ability to function on several systems is one
      of the main factors in its appeal. Java is an object-oriented language that also includes a robust
       type system and allows automatic memory management. It is a powerful language for creating complex
        programmes thanks to its built-in support for multithreading and security features. In addition,
         Java features a simple syntax and a comprehensive API, making it simple to learn and use.</P>

           </font face="serif" size="20px"><P>Java is a programming language and computing platform first
             released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a 
             large share of today’s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many 
             services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed
              for the future continue to rely on Java, as well.

            While most modern Java applications combine the Java runtime and application together, there
             are still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a 
             desktop Java installed. Java.com, this website, is intended for consumers who may still
              require Java for their desktop applications – specifically applications targeting Java 8. 
              Developers as well as users that would like to learn Java programming should visit the dev.
              java website instead and business users should visit oracle.com/java for more information.

                  <font face="serif" size="40px"><u>What is full stack developer</u></font>
                     <P>A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer
                       who can build both the front end and the back end of a website. The front end 
                       (the parts of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end
                        (the behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill 
                        sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the 
                        development process, they must have expertise in both.

                      A full-stack developer can work in-house or at a computer development company that 
                      engineers websites, software, and other components for other businesses.

                               </font face="serif" size="20px"><P>Data structures and algorithms are a 
                                critical part of a computer science education, though not something that
                                 most bootcamps graduates or self-taught people will know very well.

                                This guide will serve as an introduction to data structures and 
                                algorithms, especially for those who do not have formal education in the 
                                space.
